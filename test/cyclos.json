    "description" : "The Cyclos REST API is described using OpenAPI 3.0. The descriptor for the api can be downloaded in both [YAML](http://localhost:8888/api/cyclos-openapi.yaml) or [JSON](http://localhost:8888/api/cyclos-openapi.json) formats. These files can be used in tools that support the OpenAPI specification, such as the [Swagger Generator](https://generator.swagger.io/).\n\nIn the API, whenever some data is referenced, for example, a group, or payment type, either id or internal name can be used. When an user is to be referenced, the special word 'self' (sans quotes) always refers to the currently authenticated user, and any identification method (login name, e-mail, mobile phone, account number or custom field) that can be used on keywords search (as configured in the products) can also be used to identify users. Some specific data types have other identification fields, like accounts can have a number and payments can have a transaction number. This all depends on the current configuration.\n\nFor details of the deprecated elements (operations and model) please visit the [deprecation notes page](https://documentation.cyclos.org/4.12/api-deprecation.html) for this version.",

For example, a direct payment beween 2 users can initially be pending administration authorization. Until it is authorized, no transfer will be generated. Once authorized, a transfer will be created. Another kind of transaction, a scheduled payment, will generate one transfer per processed installment. The kinds of transactions are:\n\n- __Direct payment__: A simple payment from / to a user or system\n  account. Depending on the configuration, can require authorization to be\n  processed.\n\n- __Scheduled payment__: A payment processed either on a single future\n  date or in several installments. Depending on the configuration, can\n  require authorization to be processed.\n\n- __Recurring payment__: A payment which is repeated for a fixed number\n  of occurrences or until manually canceled. Depending on the\nconfiguration,\n  can require authorization to be processed.\n\n- __Chargeback__: A chargeback triggers a transfer with the same origin\n  and destination as an original transfer, but with negative amount,\n  effectively returning the balance to the original account.\n\n- __Payment request__: A payment filled-in by the payee. Once the payer\n  accepts the reqiest, either a direct or scheduled payment is created\n  (which could, depending on the configuration, be pending authorization).\n\n- __External payment__: A payment to a user not yet registered on the\n  system. The payment amount is reserved to either an e-mail address or\n  mobile phone number. Once a user registers using either data, the\npayment\n  will be performed.\n\n- __Import__: A transaction that was imported from file.\n- __Ticket__: A payment filled-in by the payee but without a defined\n  payer. Once a user (the payer) approces the ticket and the ticket owner\n  (receiver) processes it, a direct payment is created (which could,\n  depending on the configuration, be pending authorization).\n\n- __Order__: Payment generated by finishing the shopping cart checkout\n  or confirming a webshop order. Depending on the configuration, can\nrequire\n  authorization to be processed."

Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by `:` (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by `:` (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=rank:bronze|silver,documentDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `rank` is either `bronze` or `silver`, and whose `documentDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=documentDate:|2001-12-31`. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a partial-match search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed or enclosed by single quotes should be used. For example: `customFields=dynamic:'business` or `customFields=dynamic:'business'`.",

For example, `customFields=rank:bronze|silver,documentDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `rank` is either `bronze` or `silver`, and whose `documentDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=documentDate:|2001-12-31`. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a partial-match search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed or enclosed by single quotes should be used. For example: `customFields=dynamic:'business` or `customFields=dynamic:'business'`.",

Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by `:` (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by `:` (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has.

For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.

For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

Is a comma-separated array, where each part consists in two parts: the internal name (or custom field id) of the field, and a value, both separated by `:` (colon). For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name; - `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name; - `email`: E-mail; - `phone`: Phone; - `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number; - `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either it is required that users either have images or not).\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request. The specific address fields are:\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field); - `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the street address, which are `addressLine1`, `addressLine2`, `street`, `buildingNumber` and `complement`. Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code; - `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box; - `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood; - `address.city`: Searches by city; - `address.region`: Searches by region (or state); - `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code. A note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`.",

If the challenge matches the NFC token\n  in Cyclos, it will be encrypted and returned. Also a new challenge will\n  be returned, which should be then encrypted by the NFC tag for later\n  being sent back;\n- `POST /nfc/personalize`: With the encrypted challenge and the\n  confirmation password (if any), this operation will update the NFC\n  token in Cyclos, so it is now assigned to the specified user. From\n  this point on, the NFC tag is operational.",

For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=rank:bronze|silver,documentDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `rank` is either `bronze` or `silver`, and whose `documentDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=documentDate:|2001-12-31`.\nA note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a partial-match search using the dynamic value label.

For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `tradeType` is either `offer` or `search`, and whose `extraDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=extraDate:|2001-12-31`.\nA note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `customFields=dynamic:'business`."

For example, `profileFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, `profileFields=field1:valueA|valueB`. The accepted fields depend on the products the authenticated user has. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `profileFields=rank:bronze|silver,birthDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name 'rank' is either bronze or silver, and whose 'birthDate' is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `profileFields=birthDate:|2001-12-31`.\n\nThe basic profile fields have one of the following identifiers:\n\n- `name` or `fullName`: Full name;\n- `username`, `loginName` or `login`: Login name;\n- `email`: E-mail;\n- `phone`: Phone;\n- `accountNumber`, `account`: Account number;\n- `image`: Image (accepts a boolean value, indicating that either\n  it is required that users either have images or not).\n\n\nIf address is an allowed profile field for search, specific address fields may be searched. The allowed ones are normally returned as the `addressFieldsInSearch` field in the corresponding result from a data-for-search request.\nThe specific address fields are:\n\n- `address`: Searches on any address field (not a specific field);\n- `address.address`: Searches on the fields that represent the\n  street address, which are `addressLine1`,\n  `addressLine2`,\n  `street`,\n  `buildingNumber` and\n  `complement`.\n  Note that normally only a subset of them should be enabled in the\n  configuration (either line 1 / 2 or street + number + complement);\n\n- `address.zip`: Searches for matching zip (postal) code;\n- `address.poBox`: Searches for matching postal box;\n- `address.neighborhood`: Searches by neighborhood;\n- `address.city`: Searches by city;\n- `address.region`: Searches by region (or state);\n- `address.country`: Searches by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code.\nA note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `profileFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `profileFields=dynamic:'business`."

However, there are some rules:\n\n  - The total amount must be equals the sum of all installment amounts;\n\n  - The first due date must be in the future;\n\n  - The due dates of all installments must be in ascending order;\n\n  - There must be at least one day between distinct due dates.\n\n- Recurring payment with the first payment immediately, the others at fixed\n  future dates: This can be achieved by setting the `scheduling` field\nto\n  `recurring` and leaving blank the\n  `firstOccurrenceDate`. It is possible to schedule a limited number of\n  occurrences, by setting `occurrencesCount`, or until it is manually\n  canceled, by leaving `occurrencesCount` empty. Also, it is possible to\n  customize the interval (default is 1 month) between each occurrence, by\n  setting the `occurrenceInterval` field.\n\n- Recurring payment starting in a future date: This can be achieved by\n  setting the `scheduling` field to `recurring`\n  and setting the `firstOccurrenceDate`.

For example, `customFields=field1:value1,field2:value2`. Sometimes multiple values are accepted. In this case, the multiple values are separated by pipes. For example, customFields=field1:valueA|valueB. Enumerated fields accept multiple values, while numeric and date fields also accept ranges, which are two values, pipe-separated. For example, `customFields=tradeType:offer|search,extraDate:2000-01-01|2001-12-31` would match results whose custom field with internal name `tradeType` is either `offer` or `search`, and whose `extraDate` is between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2001. To specify a single bound in ranges (like birth dates before December 31, 2001), use a pipe in one of the values, like `customFields=extraDate:|2001-12-31`.\nA note for dynamic custom fields: If a script is used to generate possible values for search, the list will be returned in the  corresponding data, and it is sent as a pipe-separated list of values (not labels). For example: `customFields=dynamic:a|b|c`. However, it is also possible to perform a keywords-like (full-text) search using the dynamic value label. In this case a single value, prefixed by single quotes should be used. For example: `customFields=dynamic:'business`."
